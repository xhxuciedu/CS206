        "Krylov subspace methods are a family of algorithms for solving $Ax=b$ that search for an approximate solution from a Krylov subspace. They are iterative, as opposed to direct, algorithms and usually require a fast matrix-vector product for $A$  (and possibly  $A^T$ ). The most famous Krylov subspace methods are Arnoldi, Lanczos, conjugate gradient, BiCGSTAB, and GMRES. We do not have time to cover them all. Here, we will focus on the GMRES method.\n",
